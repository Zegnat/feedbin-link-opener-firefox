# Feedbin Link Opener

[Feedbin](https://feedbin.com/) has long supported the keyboard shortcut `shift + v` to open the current item in a background tab, but it has never worked for Firefox. This add-on implements the keyboard shortcut.

Google Chrome has stopped supporting background tabs since late 2014. Feedbin released [an official extension](https://github.com/feedbin/feedbin-link-opener-chrome) for Chrome, pushing me to create this Firefox add-on.

## Installation

Find [the latest release](https://github.com/Zegnat/feedbin-link-opener-firefox/releases/latest) here on Github and download the file titled “feedbin-link-opener-firefox.xpi”. Firefox may ask you to allow installations from `github.com`, select “allow” and follow the steps Firefox presents to you.

## Licence

This add-on’s code is licensed under the MIT licence, allowing you to do pretty much whatever you want with it besides claiming you made it.
